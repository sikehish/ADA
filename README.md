## Introduction

The Analysis and Design of Algorithms (ADA) Lab is an essential part of the course that helps students gain hands-on experience in implementing various algorithms and understanding their efficiency and behavior. This repository serves as a centralized location for all the lab programs, providing an organized and accessible resource for students and educators.

## Lab Cycle Details

Each lab cycle corresponds to specific topics and algorithms covered during the course. Below is a list of lab cycles included in this repository:

1. Lab Cycle 1: Introduction to Algorithm Analysis
2. Lab Cycle 2: Sorting Algorithms
3. Lab Cycle 3: Searching Algorithms
4. Lab Cycle 4: Greedy Algorithms
5. Lab Cycle 5: Divide and Conquer Algorithms
6. Lab Cycle 6: Dynamic Programming
7. Lab Cycle 7: Backtracking Algorithms
8. Lab Cycle 8: Graph Algorithms
9. Lab Cycle 9: NP-Hard and Approximation Algorithms
10. Lab Cycle 10: String Algorithms

## Getting Started

To get started with the ADA Lab repository, you can follow the steps below to clone the repository and have all the lab programs available locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Git installed on your system. If you don't have Git, you can download it from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

> git clone https://github.com/sikehish/ADA.git

The above command will clone the entire repository to your local machine.
