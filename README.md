## Introduction

The Analysis and Design of Algorithms (ADA) Lab is an essential part of the course that helps students gain hands-on experience in implementing various algorithms and understanding their efficiency and behavior. This repository serves as a centralized location for all the lab programs, providing an organized and accessible resource for students and educators.

## Lab Cycle Details

Each lab cycle corresponds to specific topics and algorithms covered during the course. Below is a list of lab cycles included in this repository:

1. Implement Euclid’s, Consecutive integer checking and Modified Euclid’s algorithms 
to find GCD of two nonnegative integers and perform comparative analysis by 
generating best case and worst case data.<br>

2. Implement the following searching algorithms and perform their analysis by 
generating best case and worst case data.<br>
a) Sequential Search
b) Binary Search( Recursive) <br>

3. Implement the following elementary sorting algorithms and perform their analysis by 
generating best case and worst case data. (Note: Any two may be asked in the 
test/exam).<br>
a) Selection Sort b) Bubble Sort c) Insertion Sort<br>

4. Implement Brute force string matching algorithm to search for a pattern of length ‘M’ 
in a text of length ‘N’ (M<=N) and perform its analysis by generating best case and 
worst case data.<br>
